            Stephy's Kitchen is the classic American diner experience! It's all about great food and amazing value.
            Breakfasts feature eggs, omelettes, crisp bacon, large slices of ham, corned beef hash, steak tips, (Getting hungry yet?) pancakes, all sorts of juices and a great cup of Joe.
            Lunches are awesome too! burgers, club sandwiches, fries, salads and a huge selection of Val's Daily Specials like fish chowder, boneless stuffed chicken, meatloaf and more!
